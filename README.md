# TSquared
Python implementation of Hotelling's T2 for process monitoring + MYT decomposition

## Specific Implementation

Hotellingâ€™s T2 is initially for sampled distribution comparison to a reference distribution,
known as a generalization of the t-statistic for multivariate hypothesis testing.

For monitoring, a single multivariate observation is compared to a reference distribution
This is more a generalization of the z-score.
